tools: sys.exec?

Get all of the operationIds from the ./openapi.yaml file. It is to large to read all at once.
they are in the format of <object>_<actions>
for each <object> (all lowercase) create a new directory ./<object> if one does not exist.

In each directory ./v2/<object>/ create a new file tool.gpt following this exact format:

```
Name: <object>s
Export: <operationId> from ../../openapi.yaml, <operationId> from ../../openapi.yaml
```

Where the Export line is a comma seperated list of all the operationIds for an <object>
