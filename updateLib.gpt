tools: sys.exec?

Do not use grep -E it is not supported on this system.
Get all of the operationIds from the ./openapi.yaml file. It is to large to read all at once.
they are in the format of <object>_<actions>

for each <object> check if there is a directory ./<object> all lowercase. 
If there is, read the tool.gpt file, and update it to be in the following format.
Treat multiple `Name:` lines in the tool.gpt file like they were each a discrete tool.gpt file.

```
Name: <object>s
Export: <operationId> from ../openapi.yaml, <operationId> from ../openapi.yaml
```

Where the Export line is a comma seperated list of all the operationIds for an <object>

If there is an <object> that doesn't have a directory, create it and populate with a tool.gpt file.
